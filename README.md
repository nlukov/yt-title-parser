# yt-title-parser

This is a file, that uses Puppeteer to control a headless browser and scrape the title of a video and the uploader into two seperate files called `title.txt` and `channelName.txt`. 

# How to run 
1) Clone repo
2) `yarn/npm install`
3) Open the `youTubeScraper.js` file from the `src` folder
4) Put your youtube link inside `await page.goto('')` on line 11
5) Specify where you want the files saved on line 28 and 29. For example 
`fs.writeFileSync('C:/Users/user/Desktop/WebParser/example.txt', videoTitle)` where `user` is the username that you use on that pc
6) Run the following command in your terminal `node .\youTubeScraper.js` and after 2-3 seconds you should have two files with the specified name from step 5.


# Why?
This was created for fun. I wanted to see if I can scrape youtube titles and channel names using Puppteer and JS in order to use within Streamlabs OBS.
